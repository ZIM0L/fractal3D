<ul>
  <li><strong>Selecting Branch:</strong><br>
     Choose the type of fractal, "Branching Tree," "Python Tree," or "Cantor Set," to define the branching style.
  </li>
   <li><strong>Selecting Shape of branches:</strong><br>
     Select the shape of the branches, such as "Cube," "Sphere," "Cone," or "Cylinder," to customize the appearance of fractal elements.
  </li>
    <li><strong>Changing parametes:</strong><br>
     Adjust parameters like depth, size, or spacing between branches to modify the fractal's structure.
  </li>
  </li>
    <li><strong>Enabling physics:</strong><br>
     Enable physics simulation to make fractal objects respond to collisions and forces.
  </li>
   </li>
    <li><strong>Enabling post-processing:</strong><br>
     Activate post-processing effects.
  </li>
   </li>
    <li><strong>Reseting fractal to default state:</strong><br>
     Reset the fractal to its default settings.
  </li>
</ul>
